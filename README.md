### Step 1: Download and Install Visual Studio Code
1. **Go to the VS Code website**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Download VS Code**: Click on the "Download" button based on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. **Run the installer**: After downloading, open the installer file and follow the prompts to install VS Code on your system.
4. **Launch VS Code**: Once installed, open VS Code.

### Step 2: Install Extensions for HTML
VS Code works with HTML out of the box, but there are a few useful extensions to enhance your coding experience.

1. **HTML Extensions**:
    - Open the **Extensions** view by clicking on the Extensions icon on the sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + X`.
    - **Search for "HTML snippets"**: This will provide you with predefined snippets to speed up HTML development.
    - **Install "HTML Boilerplate"**: It provides easy templates to start an HTML page.
    - **Install "Live Server"** (recommended): This extension allows you to view your HTML page in the browser and auto-refreshes it whenever you make changes.

2. **Optional Extensions**:
    - **Prettier** (Code Formatter): Automatically formats your code for consistency.
    - **CSS IntelliSense**: If you plan to work with CSS, this extension provides auto-completion and hints.

### Step 3: Create a New HTML File
1. **Open a new folder** in VS Code:
   - Click on `File > Open Folder`, select or create a folder where you will store your HTML project files.
2. **Create an HTML file**:
   - Click on `File > New File` or right-click in the file explorer (in the left pane) and select `New File`.
   - Name the file with the `.html` extension, for example, `index.html`.

### Step 4: Write HTML Code
1. Open the newly created `index.html` file.
2. **Type `html:5`** and press `Tab` or `Enter` to auto-generate the basic HTML boilerplate code (this is a built-in Emmet shortcut).
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My HTML Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

### Step 5: Launch Live Server
1. **Right-click on your HTML file** in the file explorer.
2. Choose **"Open with Live Server"**. This will open your HTML file in the browser, and any changes you make will automatically refresh the browser view.

### Step 6: Start Coding
Now you can start adding more HTML elements, experimenting with CSS, and building web pages!
